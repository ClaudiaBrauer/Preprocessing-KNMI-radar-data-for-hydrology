# Preprocessing KNMI radar data for hydrology
This repository contains scripts, files and info to download and preprocess radar data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) for use in (catchment) hydrological studies.

The repository inlcudes:
- A readme (pdf) with instructions on how to download several KNMI datasets, extract a certain area and save them as time series.
- An overview (xls) of the (radar) precipitation datasets available from the KNMI data portal.
- A zip file with the scripts, coordinates and some examples.
- A separate zip file with the coordinates for the EURADCLIM dataset.

Specific examples are made for the following commonly used products:
-	IRC RTCOR: for real-time applications
-	IRC RFCOR: for offline studies after 2018
-	RAC: for offline studies (starting) before 2018
-	EURADCLIM: for studies (partly) outside the Netherlands
-	KNMIâ€™23: climate scenarios (not radar but model output)
