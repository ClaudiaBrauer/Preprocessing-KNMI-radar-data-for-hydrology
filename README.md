# Preprocessing meteo data for hydrology
This repository contains scripts, files and info to download and preprocess meteo data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) for hydrological analyses.

The repository inlcudes:
- A readme (pdf) with instructions on how to download several KNMI datasets, extract a certain area and preprocess them to time series which can be used for studies in (catchment) hydrology.
- An overview (xls) of the (radar) precipitation datasets available from the KNMI data portal.
- A zip file with a collection of scripts,

Specific examples below are made for the following commonly used products:
-	IRC RTCOR: for real-time applications
-	IRC RFCOR: for offline studies after 2018
-	RAC: for offline studies (starting) before 2018
-	EURADCLIM: for studies (partly) outside the Netherlands
-	KNMIâ€™23: climate scenarios (not radar but model output)
